	<p>Neural Networks— Explained in a simple way: </p>
<p>Imagine teaching a toddler to recognize fruit. You show them many pictures, saying “This is an apple,” “This is a banana.” Over time, they learn to spot patterns: apples are round and red, bananas are long and yellow.</p>
<p>A neural network works kind of like that toddler’s brain—it learns by seeing examples and spotting patterns. It’s made of layers of “neurons”, which are tiny decision-makers. Each neuron looks at bits of the data and passes its conclusion to the next layer. By the end, the network has built a smart guess—like saying “This picture looks like an apple.”</p>
<p>But just like a toddler might sometimes call a tomato an apple, neural networks learn best when they get lots of practice and feedback.
<p>Below is the screenshot of the explanation page created for introducing Neural Networks simply.</p>

    <h2>Title</h2>
    <p><strong>Neural Networks – Explained Simply</strong></p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
   <p>
    As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into business, education, and everyday life, understanding its foundational concepts is essential. One such concept is the neural network, a key component of many machine learning systems. However, technical jargon and complex mathematics can create barriers for non-experts. 
  </p>
  <p>
    This artifact was created to bridge that gap by offering a clear, approachable explanation of neural networks using real-world analogies and visual breakdowns. Inspired by Albert Einstein’s quote, “If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough,” the goal is to make learning both effective and inclusive.
  </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
    This artifact is a standalone HTML page that explains the concept of neural networks in a simple, engaging format. It begins with a relatable analogy—teaching a child to recognize animals—and gradually builds up to more structured technical concepts like input layers, hidden layers, and outputs.
  </p>
  <p>
    The explanation is delivered using bullet points, headings, and progressive disclosure techniques that guide the reader step by step without overwhelming them. It also includes optional links, visuals, and download formats to accommodate different learning styles and devices. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The artifact is suitable for training sessions, student projects, corporate learning programs, or any situation where basic AI/ML literacy is needed.
  </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
    The primary objective of this artifact is to simplify a technical concept—neural networks—so that non-technical audiences can grasp its purpose, structure, and impact. In doing so, it supports broader goals of digital literacy, AI adoption, and change readiness in organizations and learning environments.
  </p>
  <p>
    Specifically, this project aims to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Break down the complexity of neural networks into clear, digestible parts</li>
    <li>Encourage curiosity and engagement from people outside of STEM fields</li>
    <li>Enable educators, change leaders, and trainers to use this content as a foundation for discussion or further study</li>
    <li>Demonstrate effective communication and design of technical ideas as part of a portfolio of work</li>
  </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Used ChatGPT to brainstorm analogies and explanations</li>
      <li>Designed layout using HTML and CSS</li>
      <li>Included an SVG diagram of a neural network</li>
      <li>Wrote and refined content in small digestible sections</li>
      <li>Tested and adjusted readability for clarity</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Tools and Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>HTML & CSS</li>
      <li>ChatGPT (OpenAI)</li>
      <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
      <li>GitHub Pages (optional for deployment)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Value Proposition</h2>
    <ul>
	<li><strong>Explanation: </strong>This artifact helps demystify neural networks for learners, educators, and professionals with no technical background.</li>

    <li><strong>Unique Value: </strong>Combines analogy-based teaching with clean visuals and simple code that can be repurposed in classrooms, corporate trainings, or onboarding materials.</li>

    <li><strong>Relevance: </strong>AI and machine learning are critical in today’s digital world. Clear explanations empower organizations to embrace change and innovation more confidently.</li>
