    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Adaptive learning is reshaping how individuals and systems respond to feedback and change.
        It encompasses the ability to learn from past experiences and adjust dynamically to new situations.
        This principle applies both to educational technology and organizational change leadership.

      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        In educational technology, machine learning enables adaptive learning systems that personalize educational content.
        These systems analyze a learner's performance and interactions to tailor content delivery, supporting individual growth at scale.
        In organizations, adaptive learning reflects a leader’s capacity to evolve based on feedback, results, and real-world shifts.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>
        To explore how adaptive learning manifests in both machine learning environments and human leadership,
        highlighting their shared reliance on feedback, flexibility, and iterative improvement.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>
        This artifact was developed by analyzing machine learning-enabled education tools and leadership theory.
        It draws parallels between algorithmic adaptation in machines and behavioral adaptation in humans,
        providing a holistic view of learning systems.
